HR Analysis Project
## This project involves a comprehensive analysis of HR data to uncover key insights into employee salaries and attrition patterns. The workflow integrates data cleaning, modeling, and visualization using multiple tools and technologies.

🔧 Tools & Technologies:
Python: Data cleaning and preprocessing

SQL: Database schema design and querying

Machine Learning: Predictive models for salary and attrition

Power BI: Interactive dashboard for business insights

🧹 Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers using Pandas.

Standardized column names and converted data types.

Engineered features to improve model performance.

🤖 Machine Learning Models:
Salary Prediction Model:

Trained regression models to predict employee salaries based on experience, education, and job role.

Evaluated performance using RMSE and R² scores.

Attrition Prediction Model:

Built classification models to predict employee attrition (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees).

Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

🛢️ SQL Schema:
Designed a relational schema to store HR data (employees, departments, salaries, etc.).

Created queries for KPI extraction and reporting.

📈 Power BI Dashboard:
Developed an interactive dashboard to visualize:

Employee demographics

Attrition trends

Salary distribution

Department-wise metrics

Enabled filters and slicers for dynamic reporting.

🎯 Goals:
Help HR departments identify trends and make data-driven decisions.

Improve employee retention and compensation planning.
